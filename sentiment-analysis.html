We were allocated this hotel as part of a tour. On arrival we were met by friendly staff and shown to our first floor room, which overlooked the Jal Mahal. The room was well appointed, comfortable and clean. The pool area was well maintained and very welcome after a long days sightseeing. We had breakfast and an evening meal in the restaurant and there was a wide choice of food to suit all tastes. The staff were really nice, but seemed to lack direction and maybe some stuff was lost in translation, but you had to keep asking for the whereabouts of your food and drink.
We learned that this was pretty standard throughout the hotels, so we got used to it. In conclusion, this is a really comfortable clean hotel in a nice part of the city. I would recommend it
